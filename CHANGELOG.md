### Breaking Change
IMPORTANT! This release includes the following potentially breaking changes:

- Plugins now exit with status `3` (unknown) when encountering an
  exception or being run with bad arguments.
- Removed support for Ruby 1.9 and earlier.
- Deprecated filtering methods in this library are now disabled by default. For more information read this [blog post](https://blog.sensuapp.org/deprecating-event-filtering-in-sensu-plugin-b60c7c500be3)

## [v1.4.5] - 2017-03-07
### Added
- Added support for globally disabling deprecated filtering methods via the
  `sensu_plugin` configuration scope. See README for example.

### Fixed
## [v1.4.4] - 2016-12-08

- Fixed a regression in Sensu::Handler `api_request` method, introduced in
  v1.4.3, which broke silence stashes and check dependencies on Ruby 2.x.

## [v1.4.3] - 2016-10-04
### Fixed
- Fixed an incompatibility with Ruby 1.9 introduced in Sensu::Handler api_request circa sensu-plugin 1.3.0
- Fixed Sensu::Handler check dependency filtering by using plural form `events` API endpoint, instead of singular-form `event`.
- Fixed a condition where `config_files` method may attempt to read from a non-existent file.

## [v1.4.2] - 2016-08-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a condition in which empty strings in check `dependencies` attribute values would cause an exception. (#147 via @rs-mrichmond)

## [v1.4.1] - 2016-08-03
### Fixed
- Actually fix dependency loading problems in Ruby 1.9 environments by changing 'json' dependency from `<= 2.0.0` to `< 2.0.0`. (#149 via @cwjohnston)

## [v1.4.0] - 2016-07-20

### Breaking Change
- Filtering of events is now deprecated in `Sensu::Handler` and will be removed in a future release. See [this blog post](https://sensuapp.org/blog/2016/07/07/sensu-plugin-filter-deprecation.html) for more detail.

### Changed
- Warnings are now visible in handler output when deprecated event filtering is used, as it is by default. (#139 via @cwjohnston)
- Filtering of events can now be disabled on a per-check basis by setting value of custom attribute `enable_deprecated_filtering` to `false` (#139 via @cwjohnston)
- Filtering of events based on occurrences can now be disabled on a per-check basis by setting value of custom attribute `enable_deprecated_occurrence_filtering` to `false`  (#139 via @cwjohnston)
- The `deep_merge` implementation has changed to mirror that of Sensu Core (#123 via @amdprophet):

 > Previously, if there were two conflicting data types in the same namespace (e.g. a Hash in one file, and an Array in another), sensu-plugin would throw an exception. It will now only use whatever loaded first, which is how Sensu Core handles this problem.

- The api_request method now defaults `api` configuration host 127.0.0.1 and port 4567 when configuration has not been provided via `SENSU_API_URL` environment variable nor Sensu JSON configuration.
- Dependency on 'json' changed to '<= 2.0.0' to avoid dependency loading problems in Ruby 1.9 environments. (#138 via @nibalizer)

### Fixed
- Now explicitly requiring 'json' in sensu-plugin/utils to avoid empty settings confusion (#141 via @zroger)
- Project tests updated to silence warnings by using `Minitest::Test` (#132 via @amdprophet).
- Now exiting with return code `3` (UNKNOWN) when plugin `require` statements raise an exception. Previously this would cause plugins to exit with status `0`. (#121 via @fessyfoo)

## [v1.3.0] - 2016-06-06

### Changed
- Refresh logic changed to subtract occurrences threshold before comparison; this changes alerting behavior in certain cases. (#82 from @ghicks-rmn)
- Update `Sensu::Handler` class to use `Timeout.timeout` in lieu of `Object#timeout` deprecated in ruby 2.3.0 (#117 from @ab)
- Update dependency on mixlib-cli from '>= 1.1.0' to '>= 1.5.0' (aa59019 from @mattyjones, see #93)
- Timeout for API requests in `stash_exists?` method increased from 2 seconds to 5 seconds. (3e9ac7e from @analytically, see #99)

### Added
- When set, value of SENSU_API_URL environment variable will supersede `api` settings when constructing API URL (#81 from @AlexisMontagne)
- `api_request` method now supports https and http URLs as the value of `api.host`, backward compatible with non-url values (#102 from @zbintliff ).
- New `Sensu::Mutator` base class for writing mutator plugins (#106 from @zbintliff)
- Checks now only run at_exit when @@autorun is not false.  This allows for easier rspec testing of checks and is how handlers currently work.(#116 from @zbintliff)

### Fixed
- `bail` method now properly returns error message in certain failure cases (#78 from @quodlibetor)
- `Sensu::Plugin::CLI::Graphite` no longer appends unnecessary line endings to output which cause graphite to drop metrics (#114 from @petecheslock)
